BOOLEAN OPTIONSET
================

A PCF Control to allow you to set a Boolean field to a drop down instead of a toggle.  Typically Booleans fields can be made into drop down easily using the form editor but on certain version of dynamics there is a bug which only allows Toggle style fields within Business Process Flow (BPF) screens.  This control will allow you to have a drop down again on those BPF forms.

# Installation Usage
To utilize this control you can follow the [these instructions](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Automate-Community-Blog/Preview-Custom-Controls-in-Business-Process-Flows/ba-p/263237) for adding custom PCF components to BPF forms.
